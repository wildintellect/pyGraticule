{"ALG_DESC": "Creates a Graticule (Vector Grid) of line objects in GeoJson format. Specifically this method creates lines with dense points so that they reproject as smooth curves.\n\nUsually you create it using the Coordinate System you want to overlay (e.g. Lat/Lon) and then reproject it afterwards on top of your map in a different CRS.\n\n More Details: https://github.com/wildintellect/pyGraticule ", "maxY": "maximum Y (e.g. Latitude or Northing) value (in coordinate system units) of the bounding box for the region you want to cover.", "graticule": "(Optional) Shapefile for auto loading at the end of creation. Directly converted from GeoJson. Specificy or Save As aftewards if you want something besides geojson.", "density": "How often to put a point node in the line. The smaller the number the more points and the smoother the reprojected line. The trade off is in file size.", "ALG_CREATOR": "Alex Mandel", "outfile": "GeoJson file to save result. Make sure to specifiy .geojson or .json in the file format selection. Leave as default temp file if you don't need the geojson.", "maxX": "maximum X (e.g. Longitude or Easting) value (in coordinate system units) of the bounding box for the region you want to cover.", "minX": "minimum X (e.g. Longitude or Easting) value (in coordinate system units) of the bounding box for the region you want to cover.", "minY": "minimum Y (e.g. Latitude or Northing) value (in coordinate system units) of the bounding box for the region you want to cover.", "step": "The spacing between lines you want in map units (e.g 10 for a line every 10 degrees).", "ALG_VERSION": "1", "ALG_HELP_CREATOR": "Alex Mandel"}
